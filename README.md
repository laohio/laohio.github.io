OVERVIEW
--------
This repository contains the information that makes up my personal website, which is still a work in progress. Around 5 hours were probably spent implementing the HTML/CSS, with another hour or so was spent setting up the proper file directories to link my local repository to the GitHub repository.

IMPLEMENTATION
--------------
All aspects of the work appear to be correctly implemented, as the HTML code passes the guidelines of "http://validator.w3.org/" and the CSS code passes the guidelines of "http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/".

COLLABORATION:
-------------
This project was written with the assistance of 3 COMP20 TAs.

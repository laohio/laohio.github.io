		<h1> Who I Am </h1>
	<div class="summary"> 
	<p> My name is Nicholas Ficeto.  I am currently a sophomore at Tufts University pursuing a
	degree in Economics, as well as a minor in Computer Science.  I have a large interest in the
	advent of the "Fourth Industrial Revolution", and the implications that rapid digitalization
	have on economies worldwide.  I hope to study abroad in Shanghai to do research on economic
	affairs of China and their effects on the United States.  In my spare time I enjoy playing 
	guitar and daydreaming.
